# BB Games Feature / Requests
You can [report or request](https://github.com/BB-Games/gamemode-issues-requests/issues) features in this repository instead of our [forums found here](https://bbservers.co.uk/forums/index.php?forums/suggestions-bugs.223/).

Ideally we prefer if the majority of bugs / requests are posted here however we appreciate that many may still prefer to continue using the forums which is accepted (especially as many of our users may have a forum account, but not a Github account). 

## Etiquette 
- Keep issues / requests to one per issue. 
  - Don't combine issues / requests either.
- Use the provided templates and don't stick on random tags.
- If you've had an issue, e.g. not receiving something you donated for then please contact us directly via the forums, Discord or [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981751723). 

### Bug reports
- Make sure the bug hasn't been reported already, if it has feel free to use emoji to +1 it.
- Anything potentially 'gamebreaking' like somehow gaining unlimited cubes or security, feel free to ping us directly via [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981751723) / Discord instead.

### Requests
- Don't suggest powerups / power creep bonuses to select groups of people, e.g. donators.
- If a request has been denied, please don't re-open an issue requesting the same thing _unless_ it is somehow notable different. 
  - Likewise don't re-open the same request over at the forums or vice-versa.
